// The dashboard can do the same to a wrapped session from afar: it records a pause or resume
// on the session, and the sidecar picks it up from its heartbeat response (see cmdWrap),
// so a teammate can park an agent without a terminal on its machine.

// pauseAction is one session's outcome, shared by both commands' --json output.

Each paused session comes back where it was: SIGCONT in its own terminal when that terminal
still exists, or a fresh terminal otherwise. A saved session whose terminal is gone — closed,
or lost to a reboot — is reopened the same way; one that is still running is left alone. A
fresh terminal is a VS Code integrated terminal when the session lived in VS Code and the
Conductor extension is installed, else a tmux window, the platform's terminal app, or a
detached tmux session — running the harness's own resume invocation
(claude --continue, codex resume --last, opencode --continue). Set CONDUCTOR_TERMINAL to
choose the terminal, e.g. CONDUCTOR_TERMINAL="kitty --directory {cwd} sh -c {cmd}".
